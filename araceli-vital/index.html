<h1>Navigating College Life After Becoming A Young Parent</h1>
<h2>Being a parent has proven to be an unknowing &amp; hard lifelong milestone for both parent and child.</h2>
<p>So how do you navigate jumping from being a child straight into becoming a parent? Everyone knows when you become a college student it will be a time
<br>of failing and finding yourself. College life is universally known to be a time to fail and learn unaided to discover motivation to better yourself. In short,
<br>independence is key to focusing on yourself but how do you achieve this if you are too focused on keeping another person fed, changed, healthy, happy, and loved?
 <br>While it is easier said than done a balance must be found to pride yourself both as a person and a parent.    
</p>
<h2>Components of Finding a Balance:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let go of the belief your personality is just a parent</li>
<li>Rewarding yourself with any small achievement made as a person or parent</li>
<li>Allowing yourself time for going out with friends every once in a while</li>
</ol>
<h3>Communities Everywhere Encourage These Morals</h3>
<p>Whether someone is seeking an online community or in-person interaction there is an endless amount of support resources everywhere. Anyone can search for local 
<br>groups on popular sites like Facebook where you can easily navigate for specified groups and events to take part in. Other popular places to find support can 
<br>be local kid-focused facilities like park districts, daycares, school events, and even playgrounds. These locations are all great options to meet people
<br>who have a mutual focus on finding a balance and a bigger support system to accomplish that goal. Many credited health sites like the Country Health Ranking,
<br>encourage group-based parenting programs for it's benefits in mental health amongst parents and their children.
