    <h2>Dr&#46; Jekyll &amp; Mr&#46; Hyde</h2>
    <p>
        While they aren&#39;t as iconic in current pop culture as a monster such as Dracula&comma; you probably have
        some idea of who the characters Jekyll &amp; Hyde are. From cartoons to costume stores&comma; references are
        made often to the general story and idea of a good scientist who transforms into his evil alter ego. What
        many people don&#39;t know&comma; though&comma; is that the characters themselves are originally from a
        narrative with plenty significant differences from the story we retell today. For example&comma; a fun
        fact&mdash;in the original 1886 novella&comma; Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">
            <i>Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>
        </a>&comma; Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are presented as two completely seperate people&comma; with
        the fact that they&#39;re the same man being a twist toward the end of the story that shocked the readers
        of the time.
        <br>
        This is the case for nearly every character we think of when we think Halloween. Iconic monsters we dress as or
        watch onscreen every October all have their origin stories, and many of them were vastly different from how
        they&#39;ve grown to be known in popular culture.
