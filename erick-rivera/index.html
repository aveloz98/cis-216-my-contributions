</h1> 
<h2>
    Patience is key

</h2>  
<p>When dealing with a customer, it is <span class="underline">imperative</span> to be patient with them, as they may not be as tech-savvy as you are. Many will be in a panic, others might act rudely and some may even claim to know more than you do. But it is important to remember that they are coming to you for help and your job help them with any problem their devices may have. But above all, you must be respectful and patient.

<h2>Tips &amp; Resources</h2>
<ol type="I">
    <li>Avoid using technical terms: The customer won&#39;t likely know what they mean, opt for using simpler language or explain what the term means. <span class="underline">Simple communication</span> with clear steps will help solve the problem quicker.</li>
    <li>Stay calm: Try not to get angry or anger the customer any further, the customers are already upset that their equipment isn't working properly. Be kind and understanding and avoid rude language. </li>
    <li>Keep in touch with the customer: It is also important to remain in touch with the customer even after the technical problem has been solved to make sure that everything stays working properly later.</li>
