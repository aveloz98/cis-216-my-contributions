        <h2>AI in the Transportation Industry</h2>
        <p>
            The Transportation Industry uses Artificial Intelligence(AI) in their systems in many different ways including helping in 
            traffic management and autonomous vehicles. AI algorithms can analyze current traffic data to change traffic signals and 
            reroute drivers to less congested roads to prevent any traffic jams. This also helps drivers reduce their travel time and fuel 
            usage. Autonomous vehicles use AI to work properly, because the AI algorithm is able to mimic human behavior when driving. It 
            is able to recognize traffic signals, pedestrians, other vehicles, road conditions, traffic patterns, lane merges, and lane 
            changes. With the use of AI, the number of accidents of distracted and aggresive driving will be reduced.
