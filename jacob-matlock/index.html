<h1>Life as a College athlete</h1>\
<h2>Being a student athlete comes with its challenenges</h2>
<p>Balancing the demands of being a college athlete with working and maintaining a home life can be incredibly challenging.Athletes already have
<br>a packed schedule with practices, workouts, games, and travel. Adding a job and family responsibilities on top of that can leave little time 
<br>for rest or relaxation. Juggling schoolwork, work shifts, and home life requires efficient time management. Missing one commitment can have 
<br>a domino effect on others.
</p>
<h2>Tips &amp tricks for managing the schedule</h2>     
<ol Type = a>
    <li>Create a list of tasks</li>
    <li>Use each activity as a break from the other (practice is a break from school, work a break from practice ect.)</li>
    <li>Get plenty of sleep</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cordinate with your peers</h3>
<p>Cooperate with your teammates, classmates, and coworkers to help you succeed. Peer cooperation provides a chance for mutual encouragement.
<br>When everyone is pushing toward the same goal, it's easier to stay focused and energized. Collaborating with peers exposes you to
<br>different approaches and ideas. Maybe a peer has a more efficient way of tackling a task, and by working together, you can learn new 
<br>time-saving techniques. Here is a video of a college athlete going through thier experience <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9MwB7OMTs"target="_blank "> Youtube </a>
