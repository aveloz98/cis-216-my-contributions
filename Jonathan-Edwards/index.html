<h1> Jonathan's ponderings on his interests</h1>
<h2>The Netflix Daredevil series is the greatest representation of a live action comic book character of all time &amp; I'm serious y'all</h2>
<p>Note that I said "Live action" because the greatest non-comic book piece of comic media is the first Spider-verse movie.
 But the best live action is Daredevil bar none. And don't go "Oh but Dark Knight" cause that movie got hard carried by Ledger RIP
to a GOAT. Anyway I love Christopher Nolan don't even get me started on Interstellar but I wouldn't want him to do another superhero movie.

<h2>My top 3 comic book media that aren't comic books</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>Into the Spider-Verse</li>
<li>Daredevil</li>
<li>Matt Reeves The Batman</li>
