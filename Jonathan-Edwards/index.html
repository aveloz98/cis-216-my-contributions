<h1> Jonathan&#39;s ponderings on his interests</h1>
<h2>The Netflix Daredevil series is the greatest representation of a live action comic book character of all time &amp; I&#39;m serious y&#39;all</h2>
<p>Note that I said &quot;Live action&quot; because the greatest non-comic book piece of comic media is the first Spider-verse movie.
 But the best live action is Daredevil bar none. And don&#39;t go &quot;Oh but Dark Knight&quot; cause that movie got hard carried by Ledger RIP
to a GOAT. Anyway I love Christopher Nolan don&#39;t even get me started on Interstellar but I wouldn&#39;t want him to do another superhero movie.
