    <h2>The Seed Is Planted</h2>
    <p>
        I started to learn about <span class="underline">HTML</span> and <span class="underline">CSS</span> when I was in <span class="underline">middle</span> school. 
        I had attended a class that showed how to create websites using HTML and CSS with Khan Academy.
        Since then, web development and design has been in my mind since then.
        I still haven't lost my skill, although it is a bit rusty at times.
